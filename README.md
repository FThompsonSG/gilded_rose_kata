# Roman Numeral Converter Project

- This project manages the quality value of various items on sale in a fictional fantasy shop
- My tests try to cover all different object and contextual situation that would change the rate of quality increase/decrease
- The original code was exceedingly hard to read and felt very bloated, so I have refactored the code and extract a lot of the functionality into separate cleaner methods
